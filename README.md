# About this project.
I made this project in order to learn how to programmatically edit/create images, and to help hololive fans visualize the schedule in a simpler, more understandable way.</br></br>
This bot transforms the plain-text schedule posted by hololive on their official Twitter account into an image while keeping the right aspect ratio so it looks good both on Twitter and Discord (see samples below).
</br></br>
**This project is no longer being maintained** since hololive moved their schedules from Twitter to their [official site](https://schedule.hololive.tv/). I made another bot that scraps the information from that page and posts it in `#hololive-schedules` on the Hololive Fan Discord server ([invite link](https://discord.com/invite/holofans)). I'd love to share the code for that one as well, but the server is quite big in size, so for security reasons I've decided not to.
